# Lighting

Which lights the renderer has, how many it draws, and which ones cast
shadows. `rusting schema point_light` (and `spot_light`,
`directional_light`) gives each field with its units and typical values.

## Light types

| Light | Scene key | Shadows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sun | `directional_light` | Yes, with `"shadows": true`. Only the first shadowed directional light casts them. |
| Lamp | `point_light` | No. |
| Cone | `spot_light` | Yes, with `"shadows": true`, when no directional light casts them. |
| Flat fill | `rusting.ambient_light` | No; it lights everything equally. |
| Sky and ground fill | `rusting.sky_light` | No; up-facing surfaces get `sky_color`, down-facing ones `ground_color`. |

Point lights pass through walls: a lamp lights the room behind a wall as far
as its `range` reaches. Keep each `range` inside its room and put lamps near
room centres. A spot light with `"shadows": true` stops at walls, so a
flashlight does not light the far side of a door. One light per frame casts
shadows: the first directional light with `shadows`, or, when there is none,
the first spot light with `shadows`. A mesh's `cast_shadows` and
`receive_shadows` apply to that one shadow.

## Brightness and direction

A directional light's `illuminance` is in lux: 100000 is the midday sun and
lights a white surface facing it at full brightness before exposure. Point
and spot light `intensity` is in renderer units on the same scale: 1000
lights a surface up close as brightly as that sun, fading to nothing at
`range` as `(1 - distance/range)^2`. The built-in art presets use:

| Preset | Sun `illuminance` | Ambient `intensity` | Sky `intensity` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `daylight` | 100000 | 0.1 | 0.35 |
| `golden_hour` (dusk) | 70000 | 0.08 | 0.3 |
| `night` (blue moonlight) | 20000 | 0.06 | 0.2 |
| `dark_interior` | 30000 | 0.02 | 0.05 |

Lamps on top of them: a desk lamp in a dark room is 400 to 1500, a bright
party light 3000 to 8000.

`rusting preset list --json` prints every preset's full values, and
`rusting preset apply <scene> <name>` writes one into a scene. Tone-mapping
`exposure` scales everything at once.

Directional and spot lights shine along their object's -Z axis, the same
way a camera looks. An unrotated spot light points at the horizon toward
-Z; to aim it straight down, rotate it -90 degrees (`-1.5708` radians)
about X. Point lights shine in every direction, so their rotation does not
matter.

## How many lights draw

The renderer draws at most 64 lights a frame at `High` quality, 32 at
`Balanced` and 16 at `Eco` (`/render/quality` in the scene). `Auto` picks
`Eco` on an integrated GPU, `Balanced` on a discrete GPU with less than
4 GiB of video memory, and `High` otherwise (64 on an RTX 3060). Budget for
the lowest quality the game supports. Ambient and sky light do not count.

Past the cap, lights are dropped in this order: directional lights are kept
first, then point lights, then spot lights; within each kind, lights are
taken in entity order, which is the order objects were created in. So a
flashlight spot light is the first thing to go in a building with many
lamps. Hidden objects (`visible: false`, or under a hidden parent) do not
count, so hiding lamps in rooms the player is not in keeps the count down.

`rusting capture --json` (`data.render`) and `rusting test --json`
(`perf.render` of each scenario that renders) give the dropped count as
`dropped_lights`; zero means every light drew.
