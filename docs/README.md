# RustingEngine documentation

Start with **Getting started**, then work through the tutorials in order.
Each tutorial builds a small, working game. The commands and code in them
were run against this version of the engine.

## Start here

- [Getting started](getting-started.md): install the tools, open the editor,
  create a project, and press Play.
- [Core concepts](concepts.md): projects, scenes, cooking, frames and fixed
  ticks, CPU and GPU physics, and where game code runs.

## Tutorials

1. [Hello cube](tutorials/01-hello-cube.md): move and spin a scene object
   from Rust with the short `rusting_game!` API. (Editor or CLI, 10 minutes.)
2. [Coin Run from the command line](tutorials/02-coin-run-cli.md): create a
   complete 2D game from the starter template, change it with scene
   patches, test it with a scenario, capture a screenshot, and export it.
3. [Gameplay plugins](tutorials/03-gameplay-plugin.md): write ECS systems,
   read input through named actions, and save your own components in
   scenes.
4. [GPU cube rain](tutorials/04-gpu-cube-rain.md): simulate thousands of
   bodies on the GPU and get only the events you ask for back in Rust.

## Guides and reference

- [Editor guide](../editor_gui.md): areas, Scene View navigation and the
  transform gizmo, Hierarchy, Inspector, assets, Preview and Play, export,
  the Profiler, and keyboard shortcuts.
- [README: headless CLI](../README.md#headless-project-cli): every `rusting`
  command, scene patches, and the scenario format.
- `rusting schema`: the full catalog of commands and scene components, with
  each field's default, unit, and valid range. It is generated from the
  engine itself, so it is always current.
- [Determinism](determinism.md): what makes a simulation reproducible, state
  hashes, `rusting determinism`, and replays.
- [Architecture](../architecture.md): how the runtime, renderer, and editor
  fit together.
- [WebAssembly scripts](scripting.md): the optional sandboxed scripting
  host for modding and designer logic, its host functions, and its limits.
- [Development environment](dev-environment.md): iteration speed targets, running GPU tests without a
  GPU (lavapipe).
- [Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md): what changed in each release.
- [Roadmap](../roadmap.md): what is done and what comes next.
