//! Client-side prediction and reconciliation for the objects a player
//! steers.
//!
//! The client applies each tick's input at once instead of waiting a round
//! trip, keeps the inputs the host has not confirmed, and sends them. The
//! host applies them and replies with its state and the last input tick it
//! applied. [`Prediction::reconcile`] then takes the host's state and
//! replays the inputs still unconfirmed on top of it, so a correct
//! prediction changes nothing and a wrong one is fixed without a jump back
//! in time.
