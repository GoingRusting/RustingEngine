A track writes Position, Rotation (radians), Scale, Color (RGBA), Emissive (RGB), Visible, Orientation (quaternion x,y,z,w, used by imported glTF clips), or a numeric Field of another registered component, on this entity or a child path such as Arm/Hand. Interpolation is Step, Linear or Smooth (Catmull-Rom); repeat is Once, Loop or PingPong; speed scales time. Markers in events reach game code as animation events. A clip with `blend` points is a 1D blend space: its clips are stretched to its length (1 s when 0) and the two around the `blend_parameter` value are mixed. With `blend_parameter_y` set it is a 2D blend space: each point also has `at_y`, and every point is weighted by gradient bands (a point plays alone on its spot). Transitions make a state machine: when the playing clip is `from` (empty: any) and the parameter test holds (Above, Below or Equal; at_end also waits for the clip to finish), it crossfades to `to`; the first match in list order wins. Layers play clips on top of the state on their own clocks: an override layer replaces, an additive one adds the clip's motion from its first frame, `weight` (or the `weight_parameter` value) scales it, and `mask` limits it to target paths and their children. `root_motion` (Off, InPlace, Transform, Velocity) keeps the `root_bone` Position track at its first-frame x and z and collects its horizontal motion: InPlace for game code (take_root_motion), Transform moves the object, Velocity sets its GPU body velocity through the physics command bridge. `humanoid` maps standard bone names (Hips, Spine, LeftUpperArm...) to this rig's bone paths for `rusting scene retarget`; empty matches bones by name without rig prefixes.

Draw and triangle limits draw every tick through headless Vulkan, no capture step needed, and fill `perf.render` (draws, triangles, gpu_ms, and `cameras` with each camera's gpu_ms, draws and triangles). `max_lights` limits `perf.render.lights`, the directional, point and spot lights the last frame uploaded (at most 64; `dropped_lights` counts the rest), and draws every tick like `max_draws`. `max_entities` limits `perf.entities_max`, the most live entities (scene objects, spawned copies, counters; not engine resources) after any tick. `perf.render` is null only in a scenario with no render budget, no `\"gpu\": true` and no capture or expect_pixels step",
