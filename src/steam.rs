//! Steam achievements and stats for game code.

//! Every call compiles in every build and does nothing yet: Steamworks needs
//! the `steamworks` crate, which waits on the owner's approval. The optional
//! `steam` feature is reserved for that backend, so game code written against
//! these calls today keeps working when it lands. Until then a game runs the
//! same with or without Steam installed, and these calls never fail.
//!
//! Never let these calls change simulation state: achievements are
//! presentation, like audio, and must not affect replay hashes.

/// Whether a Steam client is connected. Always `false` until the
/// Steamworks backend lands.
