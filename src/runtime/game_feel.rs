//! Game-feel kit: tweens, event-triggered sounds, burst effects, and a
//! scene-data HUD.
//!
//! Each piece is an ordinary registered scene component, so scene files,
//! `scene patch`, scenarios, and the editor inspector see and edit it:
//!
//! - [`Tween`] animates one `Transform` property between two values with an
//!   [`Easing`] curve, once, looping, or ping-ponging.
//! - [`SoundCue`] sends a [`SoundEvent`] when its body starts touching
//!   something or when game code calls [`SoundCue::trigger`]. The runner
//!   turns the event into an [`AudioQueue`](super::AudioQueue) request and
//!   plays it; see `GameScene::play_sound` for sounds from game code.
//! - [`BurstEmitter`] spawns short-lived [`BurstParticle`] entities that fly
//!   out, fall, and shrink. Particles copy the emitter's `MeshRenderer`.
//!   With a `rate` it emits every fixed step, across an `area` box.
//! - [`HudElement`] draws a text label or button over the game view (with the
//!   `ui` feature) and sends [`HudButtonPressed`] when a button is clicked.
//!   `{name}` in its text shows the value of the [`Counter`] called `name`.
//! - [`Counter`] is a named integer with an optional target, and a
//!   [`Pickup`] adds to one when a player body touches it, then hides itself
//!   and fires the cue and emitter on the same entity.
//!
//! Tweens, triggers, and particles run on the fixed step, so scenario tests
//! see the same values on every run. Burst directions come from
//! [`RandomSeed`] indexed by the fixed tick and the emitter's `SceneId`.
