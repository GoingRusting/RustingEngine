//! Sound requests. Presentation only: nothing here reads or writes
//! simulation state, and the queue is not part of state hashes.
//!
//! Game code and [`SoundCue`](super::SoundCue)s push [`AudioCommand`]s onto
//! the [`AudioQueue`]. The windowed runner plays them through the audio
//! device each frame (`audio` feature). Headless runs and `rusting test`
//! have no device: nothing drains the queue (it keeps the newest
//! [`QUEUE_LIMIT`] commands), and [`AudioQueue::requested`] still counts
//! sounds that game code asked for. The windowed runner and scenarios turn
//! `SoundCue` events into requests; scenarios read them through the
//! `audio:` entity (`/requested`, `/clips/<clip>`).
//!
//! [`route_sound_events`] also moves sounds that follow an entity, picks the
//! listener, raycasts occlusion and advances caption clocks. It only reads
//! the world, so turning audio off leaves replay hashes unchanged.
