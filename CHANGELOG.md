# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Performance

- Measured static props: 40,000 static entities cost 0.58 ms of CPU a tick in release (ignored test `static_props_cost_little_per_tick`), so no static flag is needed
- LOD groups no longer double CPU render cost: an opaque object in a `.rlod` group is one instance, and its batch picks the level per object (2085 moving objects with two levels: 0.298 ms to 0.174 ms of render CPU a frame; 0.127 ms without LOD)

### Added

- A `PlayerController` on a dynamic `RigidBody` is moved by the solver: walking steers it with a bounded force, jumps set its vertical speed, and it never tips over.
- Ground snapping for `PlayerController`: a walking player stays on the ground down ramps and steps no taller than `max_step_height` instead of hopping off them, so it can jump all the way down. `PhysicsWorld::snap_to_floor` gives the same snap to custom character code.
- `PhysicsSettings::substeps` and `ProjectRunner::set_physics_substeps` split each CPU physics step into equal substeps. Eight substeps hold a 20-link joint chain with a 50:1 tip within 2 cm, where one stretched it by metres; four rest 100 kg on 1 kg. Trade-off table in docs/concepts.md.
- `rusting.gravity_volume`: a sensor body that replaces gravity for CPU bodies inside it (zero-g rooms, wind tunnels, `toward_center` planets), with `priority` for overlaps
- Scenario reports give the game process's memory: `perf.rss_mb` at the end and `perf.rss_mb_peak` (Linux)
- Agent benchmark new-game tasks `lift-new-game` (a lift moving up and down that counts trips), `seed-planter-new-game` (numbered copies of a template, one a second) and `lamp-switch-new-game` (a key toggles a point light)
- Agent benchmark task `crate-plate-new-game`: a new-game task where pushing a crate onto a pressure plate opens a door
- Agent benchmark task `starter-flag-gate`: a bug-fix task on the starter template where the flag wins before the coins are collected
- Agent benchmark task `cube-quarter-turn`: a feature task on the 3d template where a key press turns the cube a quarter turn over 0.25 s
- Kill plane: `scene.set_kill_y(Some(y))` despawns loose dynamic CPU bodies that fall below `y`, with their children, and `scene.fell_out()` names them
- Agent benchmark task `swarm-glass-enemies`: a performance task where a blended enemy material makes every enemy its own draw call, held to a `max_draws` budget
- Agent benchmark task `jump-new-game`: a new-game task with a ball that jumps only while it rests on the floor
- Agent benchmark task `sandbox-reset`: a feature task that puts the physics sandbox's pile back at its start without reloading
- Agent benchmark task `sandbox-hail`: a performance task where over-detailed spheres break a `max_triangles` budget
- Agent benchmark task `fps-double-jump`: a bug-fix task where the first-person player can jump again in mid-air
- Agent benchmark task `tps-coins`: a feature task that adds three collectable coins to the third-person template
- `GameScene::rebind_device` rebinds an action on one device (keyboard and mouse, or gamepad) and keeps its other inputs; the `{binding:action}` HUD button now keeps the gamepad button when the player picks a new key

### Fixed

- A CPU body asleep on the floor no longer drops out of `PhysicsWorld::contacts` and `GameScene::touching`; sleepers keep the contacts they fell asleep with

### Migration

- A `.rlod` group may have at most 4 levels; loading one with more fails

## [2.3.0] - 2026-10-10

Follow-up to 2.2.0 from Rusting Raft: animated copies, cheaper moving objects and passwords for networking.

### Added

- Networking passwords: a host can require a password from joining clients, and `RUSTING_RELAY_TOKEN` makes `rusting relay` refuse hosts and clients without that token, so a relay can face the internet

### Changed

- `NetSession::host`, `host_on` and `join` take a password, and `host_room`, `join_room` and `run_relay` a relay token, as a new last argument. Pass `""` for none
- The network protocol version is 2. 2.2.0 games cannot join 2.3.0 hosts or relays, or the other way round

### Fixed

- Copies of rigged or animated models (`spawn_copy`, spawn grids) now animate: animation tracks, skin joints, ragdolls and retargeting find the copy's own bones instead of standing in bind pose. Copies of unnamed templates still have unnamed children and cannot be found by path

### Performance

- The renderer patches moved instances in place instead of repacking every instance: with 10,000 objects, 0.15 ms instead of 0.98 ms a frame for instance preparation

### Known limits

- Network passwords and relay tokens travel in plain text, and the relay does not rate-limit wrong tokens

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-10-10

Engine features asked for while building the multiplayer raft game Rusting Raft.

### Added

- Networking: `rusting_engine::net::NetSession` hosts, joins by address, or joins through a relay by room code, with reliable, ordered messages over TCP. `rusting relay` runs the relay. See `guide/networking`
- Swimming: a player controller with `swim_speed` above 0 swims in water, floats at the surface, dives while crouch is held and rises while jump is held
- Turning platforms: players riding a kinematic floor turn with it, not only move with it
- Hard shadows: `scene.set_hard_shadows(true)`, or Hard shadows in the editor's project settings, gives crisp, stair-stepped shadow edges
- Flat shading on any mesh: `flat_shading` on a material, and on `rusting.water` for low-poly waves
- Window title: `"window_title"` in `project.json`, or `scene.set_window_title`

### Changed

- New public fields: `MaterialAsset::flat_shading`, `WaterBody::flat_shading`, `RenderSettings::hard_shadows`, and `PlayerController::swim_speed`, `float_depth`, `swimming` and `floor_rotation`. Add `..Default::default()` to struct literals
- Scene format 10 stores material flat shading. Version 9 cooked scenes still load; older engine builds cannot read the new files

### Fixed

- The scenario stall watchdog no longer ends a unit-test run during long GPU tests

### Performance

- Scenes with many moving objects: when objects only move, the renderable list updates them in place instead of being rebuilt. With 10,000 objects, one moving object costs 0.36 ms instead of 6.4 ms a frame, and all moving cost 1.6 ms instead of 9.8 ms

### Known limits

- Networking is TCP only, with no unreliable channel, replication, prediction or encryption
- The renderer still repacks every instance when one object moves
- 2D platforms carry riders by translation only

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-10-09

Engine features for the horror game FOREVER BEAR, and a large batch of tools for building games with an agent.

### Added

- Gameplay without code: state machines with timed, held-input and touch transitions, health and damage, status effects, cooldowns, loot tables, dialogue, capped spawners and spawn grids
- Gameplay recipes: `rusting recipe apply` adds checkpoints, health, double jump, dash, inventory, day timer, pause menu, wave spawner or turret, each with a passing test
- Nine new game templates: twin-stick, tower defense, roguelike, card game, rhythm, racing, top-down, puzzle, empty, plus tests in every existing template
- Saves: versioned save slots for counters and objects, a save-slot list, and crash-safe writes
- Localization: locale files, plural rules, translated HUD text and a missing-translation lint
- HUD: themes from `assets/ui/theme.json`, scaling to any window, elements pinned over objects, dialogue boxes and rebindable controls with no code, and larger text for players who need it
- Audio: bus effects (low-pass, reverb, distortion, compressor, EQ), reverb zones, Doppler, falloff curves, walls that muffle sound, streaming music, pitch, seek, reverse, voice limits, mute and solo, sliding and rolling sounds, and captions
- Look: CRT and VHS screens, film grain, fog and color grading inside boxes, shadowed spot lights, text on 3D objects, camera shake, squash and stretch, hit flash and hit stop
- Gameplay helpers: tweens, `look_at`, slow motion, waypoint paths, crouching, air jumps, camera zoom and view limits
- Placeholder content: `rusting asset generate` makes meshes, textures, sprites and sound effects from a seed
- Testing: an explorer bot, fuzzing, recording a play session as a test, bisecting two builds, coverage reports and weak-test detection
- Many new `rusting lint` checks: missing objects, actions, files and translations, unreachable goals, text contrast and size, light budget, rounds with no ending
- Agent tooling: an operation journal with `rusting log` and `rusting revert`, leases for parallel agents, scene merge for git, folder-form scenes, `--offline`, `--confine` and `--read-only`, and an agent benchmark
- Performance reporting: CPU and GPU frame times, `rusting run --bench`, and an on-screen fps report under `RUSTING_PERF` (F3 toggles it)
- Editor: the Agent area shows test results and can hold outside scene edits for review, entity by entity, with undo
- Steam achievement and stat calls that do nothing yet, so games can call them today
- Sample game `forever_bear_booth`; new guides on lighting, pitfalls and the cookbook

### Changed

- `runtime::spatialize` takes a fourth `Falloff` argument; pass `Falloff::default()` for the old curve
- `runtime::hud_text` takes a third `Translations` argument; pass `None` for the old behaviour
- `ObjectState` has a `transitions` field and no longer implements `Eq`; `CpuFrameTimings` has `update` and `post_update` fields. Add `..Default::default()` to struct literals
- `Explore::goals` is `Vec<ExploreGoal>`; `"Coin".into()` still works
- `resource_state_hash` takes `&mut World`
- `rusting test` with one scenario leaves out state hashes; pass `--full` to keep them
- Commands that write project files create a `.rusting/` folder, which git ignores on its own
- Textured cylinders, cones and capsules map the full image height; a textured capsule appears flipped compared with earlier builds

### Fixed

- HUD buttons work from the keyboard and gamepad, and the HUD keeps its dark theme on a light desktop
- Exported games find their assets and load scenes cooked by another engine build
- Replays no longer diverge at tick 9 on every windowed recording
- Screenshots blend UI the same way as the game window; goldens with translucent UI may need regenerating
- Captions stay up for their whole time and hide while their sound is paused
- Long soak tests no longer grow without limit, and a stalled test fails instead of hanging
- Parallel runs of one project no longer fail at random while cooking the scene

### Performance

- Camera screens reuse the frame's physics: six screens cost about 3 ms instead of 113 ms
- Large GPU bodies no longer stall the physics pass: 20.8 ms down to under 2 ms of GPU time in the benchmark, with identical results
- Faster scenario checks, captures and color changes on large scenes

### Known limits

- Windows was checked under Wine only; gamepads, the save folder and real Windows hardware are not checked yet
- Microphone input, video on textures and the real Steam backend are not done yet

- Added roadmap and architecture documentation for future engine implementation
- Added more tests for runtime, assets, GPU layouts and perspective projection

---

## [0.1.44] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- A lot of tests

### Fixed

- A lot of different fixes to improve stability before big implementation

---

## [0.1.43] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Textures can be applied on engine build in shapes

### Fixed

- Now textures can be reused to save VRAM

---

## [0.1.42] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- A lot of docs for better user experience( description of functions/values on hover )

### Fixed

- Culling is now working much better, without bugs.
- Fixing multi gltf model import, now each texture and model render good even if there are 10k gltf models. But each texture is separate, so you cant reuse texture without vram loss, I will fix it so fast as possible.

---

## [0.1.41] - 2026-04-6

### Added

- Added gltf models import, already with Materials, Textures and everything that needed

---

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-5

### Added

- Better code, now no warnings( before was like 60 )
- Added new very heavy fragment shader with noise and other things
- Culling toggle on 'C'

### Fixed

- Culling is working well and give insane performance boost on big scenes where fragment/vertex shader is heavy. But it uses object center, so some object might disappear earlier as needed. I will fix it in next patch

---

## [0.1.32] - 2026-04-5

### Added

- Added culling( when mesh is not in view => dont render ), but its beta, so its working bad

---

## [0.1.31] - 2026-04-4

### Added

- Just made code cleaner and only fixed some problems in shaders

### Fixed

- Grid collision shader

---

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-3

### Added

- Optimizing physic shaders and fragment shaders render. Collision check was **O(n²)**, now it splitted on grid, so its **O(n*k) + O(n*j)** where k is objects count in cell and j is big objects count.
- adding more physic settings like **_friction_**, **_gravity direction_** and **_bounciness_**.

### Fixed

- Object collapse on stacking.

---

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-1

### Added

- Collision types as enum (Sphere, Box).
- Optional apply one physic/visual shader for all object on scene

### Fixed

- Better performance( main loop refactoring )

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- Initial release!
- Different fragment shader support.
- Different physic shader support.
- Physics engine with per-object collision types (Box/Sphere).
- Same speed as pure Vulkano+winit
